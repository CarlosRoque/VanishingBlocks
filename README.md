Vanishing Blocks is going to be a clone of other popular block-type games.
You will click a block and it and all of the same colored blocks surrounding
it will disappear, and you'll be rewarded points.  It is still in development
so it will be rough / incomplete for some unknown time.

I am making this game now because, in the past, I tried to recreate Tetris
and lost interest along the way.  This time, I am going to start with something
simpler and "finish" it just so I can say to myself "I've finished a game
I started."
